## SkyStone FTC Team6025 Code

This repository is the shared workspace for Team 6025 from Mason City, Iowa.
Other teams are welcome to review, use, and comment.
This year we are using a robot with holonomic drive train, i.e. four
independently controlled motors, one in each corner. 
We will also use VuForia and IMU in REV hub for navigation, and Blinkin lights 
and Star Wars sounds for flair.
Please feel free to use or adapt if you wish. If you have questions
feel free to write us at riesenw@mercyhealth.com
